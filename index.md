# End the email signoff

To whomstoever it mayeth concern,

"Thanks, regards, cheers, best wishes, as ever" What do those words mean? Nothing! There is some kind of complex obeisance system between professors and students, managers and employees, firms of different sizes, etc etc etc which is completely inscrutable to the autistic and ESL among us.

Consider this email:


```
from: employee@widgetco
to: manager@widgetco
subject: widget manufacturing details?
body:
What diameter and thickness should the widget be?
Error tolerance on those?
```

It is crisp like capn crunch. It says what must be said and nothing more.

Let's end this confusing tradition.

Much appreciated, \
